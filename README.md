# ðŸ¤– The Fact-o-Matic 3000 

In a dusty workshop, powered by lightning and questionable science, the Fact-o-Matic 3000 was born! This marvelous Python contraption has one purpose: to scour its vast, pre-loaded archives of strange knowledge and present you with a single, earth-shatteringly bizarre fact that you probably didn't need to know.

## Technical Specifications

* **Advanced Bizarreness Engine**: Randomly selects one of 100 hand-curated, shockingly true facts.
* **Dramatic Delivery Systemâ„¢**: Utilizes cutting-edge `time.sleep()` technology and ANSI color sequences for a suspenseful, retro-tech reveal.
* **Modular Knowledge Core**: The machine's "brain" (`hundred_facts.py`) is separate from its operational logic (`random_fact.py`), allowing for easy expansion of its trivia arsenal.

## How to Operate the Machine

1.  No assembly required! Just ensure you have a working Python environment.
2.  Place both `random_fact.py` and `hundred_facts.py` in the same directory. The machine needs its brain to function!
3.  Engage the device via your preferred terminal interface:
    ```sh
    python random_fact.py
    ```
4.  Stand back and witness the machine whir to life. It will dispense one (1) unit of pure, unadulterated trivia directly to your screen.
